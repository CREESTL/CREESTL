### Welcome to my little code cave

Here you can find all my progress in programming since 2017. Some of the repos might be useful for you, but others I've posted here because...why not?
Most of the repos are about computer vision because that is what I've been doing for past year or so. But now I'm looking for something new.

================================================================
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on sturying Rust and Blockchain development
- ðŸŒ± I'm always trying to learn something new in Python
